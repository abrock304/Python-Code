Python code using jupyter notebooks

### Overview

As an analyst for the grocery delivery company, Instacart, they wanted to learn more about their sales patterns. 
I used Jupyter Notebooks to perform initial data and exploritory analysis on some of their data to derive insights and suggestions
to best help thier business continue to grow. With Jupyter Notebooks, I performed cleaning, wrangling, subsetting, consistency checks,
combining, grouping, aggregating, and visualizing. By the end, I compiled an excel report with a population flow, consistentcy checks,
analysis, visualizations, and recommendations for Instacart.
